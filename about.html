                    I began learning to code as a way to cope with my PTSD at night. I had lived such
                    a crazy life that I literally couldn't sleep at night and almost 3 years in recovery
                    as well as out of the crazy mess that I was in during my addiction. Now I'm using
                    this skill to enter into a new industry.
