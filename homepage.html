                Hello, Im Johnny and this is my portfolio for Fullstack Developer. 
                When I made this poirtfolio to display my projects I also wanted to
                display my understanding of how a WebSite operates as well as the computer
                science part of it. The result is this Portfolio in the form of code. It's a 
                fully functional website that was built in moments of PTSD and Stress. Very much like
                people with their Minecraft Worlds. I plan to add to it the more I learn even on into
                my professional career.
